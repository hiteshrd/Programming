## 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree

Leetcode Linke [https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2

Output: [2,1,3]

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5

Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].

1 <= Node.val <= 107

root is a binary search tree.

1 <= val <= 107
